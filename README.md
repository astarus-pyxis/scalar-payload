# scalar-payload

SCALAR V is an experimental rocket made by students from the Supa√©ro Space Section in 2024. There were two payloads onboard this rocket, a Cansat with a particle matter sensor and a muon detector.

This repository provides the files and datasheets used to conceive the payloads of our experimental rocket SCALAR V-a.

Detailed information about this project can be found in the Final Report provided in this repository.
